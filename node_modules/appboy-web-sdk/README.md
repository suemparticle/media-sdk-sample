# Install

```
$ npm install --save appboy-web-sdk
```

This will install the Braze Web SDK files into `./node_modules/appboy-web-sdk` where you can reference them locally. Note that the Braze Web SDK is meant to be used client-side in a web application and may not work as expected in a Node.js server environment.

# Usage

```
var appboy = require('appboy-web-sdk');
appboy.initialize('YOUR-API-KEY');
appboy.display.automaticallyShowNewInAppMessages();
appboy.openSession();
```

See the [Public Github Repo](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-web-sdk#readme) for getting started instructions or [our documentation pages](https://documentation.braze.com/Web/) for use-case based documentation.
